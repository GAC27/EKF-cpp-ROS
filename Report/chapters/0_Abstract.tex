This project report deals with the  implementation of an extended Kalman Filter (EKF) on a mobile robot equipped with a laser rangefinder (LRF). The goal of the project is to estimate the pose of the mobile robot in a two dimensional environment in real time. Therefore, the available odometry information of the robot is used for the state prediction. For the observation model a map of the environment is pre-acquired and used. The laser range finder gives the observation information by scanning the robots real time environment. In the matching step of the EKF point clouds are used for comparing the predicted and the real observations.
